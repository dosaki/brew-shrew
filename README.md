# brew-shrew
Chrome extension to request your brews whenever someone goes to make one!

So far my work experience in England has included a "Would you like a brew?" every 30 minutes.

I usually have a coffee or a tea in the morning and/or in the afternoon. That's it. So my answer is "I'm all right" pretty often.
This leads to when I **do** want a brew, people may forget :(

In comes technology to further reduce human interaction but improve tea-satisfaction! Hail the Brew Shrew!
