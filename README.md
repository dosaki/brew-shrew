# Brew Shrew - your helpful reminder!
Chrome extension to request your brews whenever someone goes to make one!

# Why shrew?
 It just rhymes. I guess a shrew couldn’t remember what you’ve asked for.

# What? Why would you even do this?

So far my work experience in England has included a "Would you like a brew?" every 30 minutes.

I usually have a coffee or a tea in the morning and/or in the afternoon. That's it. So my answer is "I'm all right" pretty often.
This leads to when I **do** want a brew, people may forget :(

Also, I am pretty crap at remembering who ordered what when I make the tea runs.

In comes technology to further reduce human interaction but improve tea-satisfaction! Hail the Brew Shrew!

# Installing
Download it from here: https://github.com/dosaki/brew-shrew/raw/master/dist/brew-shrew.crx

Go to Chrome Extensions (chrome://extensions) and drop brew-shrew.crx file in there.

You should be all set up!

# Some notes
Your preferences aren’t saved in the database yet. I’m saving them in cookies, so what you save in IE won’t be available in Firefox or Chrome. If you stick to one browser it’s ok though.
The next step is going to be saving stuff on the server side and then make it try to predict which drink you would want.

As a final note: This whole thing was done in about 2 hours in total so I don’t expect that it works 100% well.
Feedback is welcome!
